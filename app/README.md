# A Minimal QtWebEngine Web Browser with Adblocker

![](screenshots/adblock.jpg)

## How Does It Work 

This is a minimal `network filter` implementation using `QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor` and `QtWebEngine`, with filters from [easylist](https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt). The parser is currently using `ad-block` from Brave, but alternatives would be needed in the future.

### Dependencies

- Qt 5.10+ with `QtWebEngine` module 
- ABP-style parser from Brave's [ad-block](https://github.com/brave/ad-block) C++ library 

    Checkout the following 3 repositories: 

        git clone https://github.com/brave/ad-block.git third_party/ad-block 
        git clone https://github.com/brave/hashset-cpp.git third_party/hashset-cpp 
        git clone https://github.com/brave/bloom-filter-cpp.git third_party/bloom-filter-cpp 

    And copy all `*.h` and `*.cc` to `third_party/ad-block`:

        cp third_party/hashset-cpp/{*.cc,*.h} third_party/ad-block/
        cp third_party/bloom-filter-cpp/{*.cpp,*.h} third_party/ad-block/

### Build Instructions 

    qmake DEFINES+=USE_ADBLOCK
    make
